# Signature-Recognition
Signature Recognition using **SVM (Support Vector Machine)** and **HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)** in C++ using opencv library and Qt for GUI. 

Project is divided in 3 parts- 

1. Item Preprocessing on training singature samples.

2. Item Feature Extraction using HOG descriptor. 

3. Item Classification using SVM.

4. Item Matching of test signature with training sample images.
